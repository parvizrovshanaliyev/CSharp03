### Code Exercise: Temperature Conversion

**Objective:**
Write a C# program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius using both implicit and explicit type casting.

**Scenario:**
You are developing a weather monitoring application that needs to convert temperature readings from Fahrenheit to Celsius for analysis. The temperature readings are received as `double` values in Fahrenheit.

**Instructions:**
1. Declare a variable `fahrenheitTemp` of type `double` and initialize it with a temperature value in Fahrenheit.
2. Declare another variable `celsiusTemp` of type `double`.
3. Perform an implicit type cast from `double` (Fahrenheit) to `int` (Celsius) and store the result in `celsiusTemp`.
4. Print a message indicating the original temperature in Fahrenheit and the converted temperature in Celsius, using the implicit type cast.
5. Repeat the process, but this time perform an explicit type cast and print the results.
6. Ensure that the program handles fractional temperatures accurately.

**Example Output:**
```
Original temperature in Fahrenheit: 98.6°F
Implicitly converted temperature in Celsius: 37°C

Original temperature in Fahrenheit: 75.5°F
Explicitly converted temperature in Celsius: 24°C
```

**Your Task:**
Write a C# program that fulfills the above requirements. You can use the console application template in Visual Studio or any C# compiler of your choice.

### Code Exercise: Currency Conversion

**Objective:**
Write a C# program that converts an amount in one currency to another currency using both implicit and explicit type casting.

**Scenario:**
You are developing a financial application that needs to convert currency amounts from one currency to another for international transactions.
The currency exchange rates are provided as `double` values.

**Instructions:**
1. Declare a variable `amountInUSD` of type `double` and initialize it with an amount in US dollars.
2. Declare another variable `exchangeRate` of type `double` and initialize it with the exchange rate from US dollars to another currency (e.g., Euro).
3. Declare a variable `amountInEuro` of type `double`.
4. Perform an implicit type cast from `double` (US dollars) to `int` (Euro) and store the result in `amountInEuro`.
5. Print a message indicating the original amount in US dollars and the converted amount in Euro, using the implicit type cast.
6. Repeat the process, but this time perform an explicit type cast and print the results.
7. Ensure that the program handles fractional amounts accurately.

**Example Output:**
```
Original amount in US dollars: $100.50
Implicitly converted amount in Euro: €88

Original amount in US dollars: $100.50
Explicitly converted amount in Euro: €88.16
```

**Your Task:**
Write a C# program that fulfills the above requirements. You can use the console application template in Visual Studio or any C# compiler of your choice.
